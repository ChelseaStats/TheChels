You can see my [curriculum vitae](https://github.com/MatBenfield/MatBenfield/blob/master/curriculum-vitae.md) and my [operating manual](https://github.com/MatBenfield/MatBenfield/blob/master/operating-manual.md). I also love listening to [podcasts so please help me find more](https://github.com/MatBenfield/TheChels.uk/issues/new?assignees=MatBenfield&labels=podcast&template=podcast.md). I am also compiling a repository of [engineering management](https://github.com/MatBenfield/engineering-management) too.

## Projects

* I have been playing with python, recently, and have created some twitter bots, most notably [tweeting breaking news](https://github.com/TheChelsOrg/bot_tocfcws_news)
* [Cheltenham open data](https://cheltenham-open-data.github.io) is an organisation that uses open data sources relevant to my hometown. Projects include using and archiving official government statistics of Covid-19, Food bank data, street crimes, where to go for lunch, and more.

## Now & Next

* [Now](https://thechels.uk/morning#Now) and [What should I be doing next?](https://github.com/MatBenfield/TheChels.uk/issues/new?assignees=MatBenfield&labels=Next&template=next.md&title=Next%3A+)
> Based on [the now page](https://thenow.page) and an idea by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/nowff)
