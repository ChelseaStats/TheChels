I work as an Engineering Manager at a B2B fintexh in the Wealth Management space, I am married with one daughter. You can see my [curriculum vitae](https://github.com/MatBenfield/MatBenfield/blob/master/curriculum-vitae.md) and my [operating manual](https://github.com/MatBenfield/MatBenfield/blob/master/operating-manual.md). I also love listening to [podcasts so please help me find more](https://github.com/MatBenfield/TheChels.uk/issues/new?assignees=MatBenfield&labels=podcast&template=podcast.md). I am also compiling a repository of [engineering management](https://github.com/MatBenfield/engineering-management) too.
