I work as an Engineering Manager at a business-to-business, api-first fintech in the wealth and advice management space. 

I wrote my first bit of HTML in a Notepad window sometime around 1999 and never really stopped, I've been hands-off day-to-day at work for several years now but I still like to dabble in my spare time.

You can see my [curriculum vitae](/cv) and my [operating manual](/manual). 


I love listening to [podcasts](/podcasts) so please [help me find more](https://github.com/MatBenfield/TheChels.uk/issues/new?assignees=MatBenfield&labels=podcast&template=podcast.md).

## Active Projects

* I have been playing with python, recently, and have created some twitter bots, most notably [tweeting breaking news](https://github.com/TheChelsOrg/bot_tocfcws_news) and [associated low-fi Chelsea official news app](https://app.thechels.uk).
*  I am also compiling a repository of [engineering management](https://github.com/MatBenfield/engineering-management) tools.
* [Boinc - Contribute computing capacity](https://boinc.thechels.uk)
* [Cheltenham open data](https://cheltenham-open-data.github.io) is an organisation that uses open data sources relevant to my hometown. Projects include using and archiving official government statistics of Covid-19, Food bank data, street crimes, where to go for lunch, and more.
