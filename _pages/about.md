## Colophon

Hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), the site uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator, on [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/). DNS and SSL by [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com). It also uses GitHub actions, GitHub issues, and some [Python](https://www.python.org) for automation. Content is written in GitHub flavoured [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). Data is stored in [Yaml](https://yaml.org) files.

It is called "weak notes" as a play on words of the popular Government "[week](https://promo.cymru/resource/weeknotes/) [notes](https://weeknot.es)" blogging style - due to the likelihood, I will be inconsistent and non-regular and having worked adjacent to Government for 16 years.

The font-family utilises the user's operating system setting via the `-system-ui` declaration, `Gill Sans` if available, and as a last resort falls back to sans-serif. The primary colour scheme is `White Smoke` as the background, `Night` for text, `Brunswick Green` for links, `Lapis Lazuli` for some additional/secondary text and `Citron` for accents e.g, borders and quote bars.

## In The Press

During an era of running a successful football analytics website I had work published on the Chelsea FC website, [FourFourTwo](https://thechels.uk/fourfourtwo-cult-heroes) [magazine](https://thechels.uk/fourfourtwo-chelsea-vs-swansea), [Man City's match day programme](https://thechels.uk/man-city-programme), the [Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2282976/Frank-Lampard-scores-200th-Chelsea-goal.html), the [Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/valencia-penalty-gary-neville-chelsea-under19s-uefa-youth-league-a6892926.html) and various club fan sites.

The Twitter account, active from 2010 to 2018, peaked at 185,000 followers with a monthly reach of 8 million users worldwide all through organic growth.

## Now

_based on the "now" page idea from Derek Sivers._

* Surviving. I continue to fight with an undiagnosed fatigue that's been ongoing since October 2022
* Reading kindle books - I have a huge backlog to get through
* Household improvements - solar panels, cladding, heat pump, new kitchen are all on the cards for 2025.
* Gardening - tending to the veggie patch and planters.
