I work as an Engineering Manager at a business-to-business, api-first fintech in the wealth and advice management space. 

I wrote my first bit of HTML in a Notepad window sometime in 1999 ish and never really stopped.

You can see my [curriculum vitae](/cv) and my [operating manual](/manual). 


I also love listening to [podcasts so please help me find more](https://github.com/MatBenfield/TheChels.uk/issues/new?assignees=MatBenfield&labels=podcast&template=podcast.md). I am also compiling a repository of [engineering management](https://github.com/MatBenfield/engineering-management) too.

## Projects

* I have been playing with python, recently, and have created some twitter bots, most notably [tweeting breaking news](https://github.com/TheChelsOrg/bot_tocfcws_news)

* [Cheltenham open data](https://cheltenham-open-data.github.io) is an organisation that uses open data sources relevant to my hometown. Projects include using and archiving official government statistics of Covid-19, Food bank data, street crimes, where to go for lunch, and more.
