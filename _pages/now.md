## Now

* Surviving. I continue to fight with an undiagnosed fatigue that's been ongoing since October 2022
* Reading kindle books - I have a huge backlog to get through
* Digital decluttering - sorting through files and photos and downsizing.

## Next

* Household improvements - new porch, solar panels, cladding, heat pump, kitchen are all on the cards for 2025.
* Gardening - tending to the veggie patch and planters.

_based on the "now" page idea from Derek Sivers._
