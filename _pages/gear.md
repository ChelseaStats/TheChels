## Mobile

My phone of choicr is the iPhone 15 Pro. I've been an iPhone user since the 4 model and generally upgrade every two or three years.


## Tablet

The iPad Pro 11 inch - 4th generation is my daily computer of choice having upgraded from a rather old yet capable MacBook Air from 2012. 

Almost everything I need to do these days can be done in the browser or via dedicated apps.

- Apple Pencil
- Magic Keyboard
- UGREEN wireless mouse
- RK ROYAL KLUDGE RK61 Wireless Mechanical Keyboard

## Watch

I wear two daily. The Apple Watch Series 9, as this is the best smartwatch available to me for noticiations, payments, calendar and smart home controls.

I also wear a Garmin 945 as I've found this to be the best activity and sleep tracking watch given it's superior battery life and it's back to start GPS tracking map is super userful when out on a long run.


## TV

Apple TVs in the usual rooms in the house, including the office.

## Listening

A pair of the second generation Airpod Pro (usb-c) model, backed up by another pair with lightning.

## Reading

I use the kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition as my device of choice for reading books, I own less than dozen physical books and would ideally move to an all digitial approach in time.

The app NetNewsWire as my RSS reader of choice and will look to subscribe to websites and blogs and tend to avoid hitting websites directly due largely to cookie polices, adverts, and shitty design.

- PocketCasts (Podcasts)
- Working Copy (Git Client)
- NetNewsWire (News/RSS)
