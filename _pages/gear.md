## Mobile

My phone of choice is the iPhone 15 Pro. I've been an iPhone user since the 4 model and generally upgrade every two or three years.


## Computing

The iPad Pro 11 inch - 4th generation is my daily computer of choice having upgraded from a rather old yet capable MacBook Air from 2012. 

Almost everything I need to do these days can be done in the browser or via dedicated apps.

- Apple Pencil
- Magic Keyboard
- Logitech MX Master 3 Wireless Mouse
- RK ROYAL KLUDGE RK61 Wireless Mechanical Keyboard

I also have a Raspberry Pi 400, but is only really used to teach my daughter about computing/coding.

## Watch

I wear the Apple Watch Series 9, as this is the best smartwatch available to me for noticiations, payments, calendar and smart home controls.

## TV

Apple TVs in the usual rooms in the house, including the office.

## Listening

Two pairs of the second generation Airpod Pro (usb-c model), on almost constant rotation.

## Reading

I use the kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition as my device of choice for reading books, or occassionaly on my iPad or iPhone. I do not own any physical books as of April 2024.

The app NetNewsWire as my RSS reader of choice and will look to subscribe to websites and blogs and tend to avoid hitting websites directly due largely to cookie polices, adverts, and shitty design.


## Apps
 
- PocketCasts (Podcasts)
- Working Copy (Git Client)
- NetNewsWire (News/RSS)

As well as the usual banking, ultility, home apps for the services I use, plus, of course, the default Apple apps.
