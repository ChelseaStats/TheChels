## Mobile

My phone of choice is the iPhone 15 Pro. I've been an iPhone user since the 4th generation model and generally upgrade every two or three years.

## Computing

iPad Pro 11 inch - 4th generation.

- Apple Pencil
- Magic Keyboard

M4 Mac Mini.

- Logitech MX Master 3 Wireless Mouse
- RK ROYAL KLUDGE NK80 Wireless Mechanical Keyboard

I also have a Raspberry Pi 400 running Homebridge.

## Watch

I wear the Apple Watch Series 9, as this is the best smartwatch available to me for notifications, payments, calendars, and smart home controls.

## TV

Apple TVs in the usual rooms in the house, including the office.

## Listening

Two pairs of the second generation AirPod Pro (USB-C model), on almost constant rotation.

## Reading

I use the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition as my device of choice for reading books, or occasionally on my iPad or iPhone. I do not own any physical books as of April 2024.

The app NetNewsWire is my RSS reader of choice and will look to subscribe to websites and blogs and tend to avoid hitting websites directly due largely to cookie policies, adverts, and shitty design.

## Apps

- Castro (Podcasts)
- Working Copy (Git Client)
- NetNewsWire (News/RSS)
- Play, x.app (Video Management and Playback)
- Drafts (Notes)
- 1Password (Password Manager)

- 1.1.1.1 VPN (VPN)

As well as the usual banking, utility, and home apps for the services I use, plus, of course, the default Apple apps.
