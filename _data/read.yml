As Daniel H. Pink explains in his paradigm-shattering book Drive, the secret to high performance and satisfaction in today's world is the deeply human need to direct our own lives, to learn and create new things, and to do better by ourselves and the world.Along the way, he takes us to companies that are enlisting new approaches to motivation, and introduces us to the scientists and entrepreneurs who are pointing a bold way forward."

    publishedDate: "2014-11-04"
    description: "Revised and Updated, Featuring a New Case Study How do successful companies create products people can’t put down? Why do some products capture widespread attention while others flop? What makes us engage with certain products out of sheer habit? Is there a pattern underlying how technologies hook us? Nir Eyal answers these questions (and many more) by explaining the Hook Model—a four-step process embedded into the products of many successful companies to subtly encourage customer behavior. Through consecutive “hook cycles,” these products reach their ultimate goal of bringing users back again and again without depending on costly advertising or aggressive messaging. Hooked is based on Eyal’s years of research, consulting, and practical experience. He wrote the book he wished had been available to him as a start-up founder—not abstract theory, but a how-to guide for building better products. Hooked is written for product managers, designers, marketers, start-up founders, and anyone who seeks to understand how products influence our behavior. Eyal provides readers with: • Practical insights to create user habits that stick. • Actionable steps for building products people love. • Fascinating examples from the iPhone to Twitter, Pinterest to the Bible App, and many other habit-forming products."

She'd never been able to think of herself as a 'runner', and the first time she forced herself out the door, she knew it would hurt. She just didn't realise how much it would heal her, too."

    description: "The old adage is ingrained in us that if you don't have anything nice to say then don't say anything at all. While this advice may work for home life, as Kim Scott has seen first hand, it is a disaster when adopted by managers in the work place.Scott earned her stripes as a highly successful manager at Google before moving to Apple where she developed a class on optimal management. Radical Candor draws directly on her experiences at these cutting edge companies to reveal a new approach to effective management that delivers huge success by inspiring teams to work better together by embracing fierce conversations.Radical Candor is the sweet spot between managers who are obnoxiously aggressive on the one side and ruinously empathetic on the other. It is about providing guidance, which involves a mix of praise as well as criticism - delivered to produce better results and help employees develop their skills and boundaries of success.Great bosses have a strong relationship with their employees, and Scott has identified three simple principles for building better relationships with your employees: make it personal, get stuff done, and understand why it matters.Radical Candor offers a guide to those bewildered or exhausted by management, written for bosses and those who manage bosses. Drawing on years of first hand experience, and distilled clearly to give actionable lessons to the reader, Radical Candor shows how to be successful while retaining your integrity and humanity. Radical Candor is the perfect handbook for those who are looking to find meaning in their job and create an environment where people both love their work, their colleagues and are motivated to strive to ever greater success."

    description: "In a highlight reel, microwave world — you're led to believe success is right around the corner: It's not working. Not only is it not working with your ability to achieve your goals, we've never been more frustrated, stuck, stressed and unfulfilled. Most personal development is all about the big and bold vision, yet these days we're not missing ambition or dreamers... We're missing results and execution. But what if there was a way to shut off the noise, fall in love with the process and take one step forward every single day as you paint your life's masterpiece? Enter The 1% Rule — a daily system designed to help you close the gap without the crushing pressure that has kept you stuck in the past. The 1% Rule was designed to answer three core questions: Why do some people seem to achieve massive success with everything they do — while others can't seem to get out of their own way? What separates those who get excited and inspired for a season, a quarter or a few months — and those who are consistently on fire? ​ What are the mindsets, principles, routines and behaviors of those who execute daily, and those who sit on the sidelines pondering? ...through answering these questions over the last decade in the trenches with thousands of people — they are now the framework of The 1% Rule and are yours today. It's time to take your power back, grab your copy now. If you're ready to ditch the highlight reel illusion... If you're tired of sitting on the sidlines waiting... If you're frustrated with the 24/7 noise... You've come to the right place!"

    publishedDate: "2005-08-18"
    description: "Think and Grow Rich has been called the \"Granddaddy of All Motivational Literature.\" It was the first book to boldly ask, \"What makes a winner?\" The man who asked and listened for the answer, Napoleon Hill, is now counted in the top ranks of the world's winners himself. The most famous of all teachers of success spent \"a fortune and the better part of a lifetime of effort\" to produce the \"Law of Success\" philosophy that forms the basis of his books and that is so powerfully summarized in this one. In the original Think and Grow Rich, published in 1937, Hill draws on stories of Andrew Carnegie, Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and other millionaires of his generation to illustrate his principles. In the updated version, Arthur R. Pell, Ph.D., a nationally known author, lecturer, and consultant in human resources management and an expert in applying Hill's thought, deftly interweaves anecdotes of how contemporary millionaires and billionaires, such as Bill Gates, Mary Kay Ash, Dave Thomas, and Sir John Templeton, achieved their wealth. Outmoded or arcane terminology and examples are faithfully refreshed to preclude any stumbling blocks to a new generation of readers."

    description: "We know what Haruki Murakami talks about when he talks about running -- but did you know that Japan has the most developed and lucrative running league in the world? Or that one of the biggest events in Japan's sporting calendar is an intensely fought marathon relay race called an 'ekiden', which gets Superbowl-like viewing figures on TV? From the marathon monks who run a thousand marathons in a thousand days in search of spiritual enlightenment, to the car and electronics companies who see their ekiden teams as a badge of corporate honour, Finn takes us on a tour of this complex, contradictory and unique running culture - and discovers what it can do for his own running style and performance."

    description: "Connecting with other people, finding a sense of belonging and the need for support are natural human desires. Employees who don't feel supported at work don't stay around for long - or if they do, they quickly become unmotivated and unhappy. At a time when organisational structures are flattening and workforces are increasingly fluid, supporting and connecting people is more important than ever. This is where organisational communities of practice come in. Communities of practice have many valuable benefits. They include accelerating professional development; breaking down organisational silos; enabling knowledge sharing and management; building better practice; helping to hire and retain staff; and making people happier. In this book, Emily Webber shares her learning from personal experiences of building successful communities of practice within organisations. And along the way, she gives practical guidance on creating your own."

    publishedDate: "2011-01-04"
    description: "A New York Times Bestseller In latest bestseller, Atul Gawande shows what the simple idea of the checklist reveals about the complexity of our lives and how we can deal with it. The modern world has given us stupendous know-how. Yet avoidable failures continue to plague us in health care, government, the law, the financial industry--in almost every realm of organized activity. And the reason is simple: the volume and complexity of knowledge today has exceeded our ability as individuals to properly deliver it to people--consistently, correctly, safely. We train longer, specialize more, use ever-advancing technologies, and still we fail. Atul Gawande makes a compelling argument that we can do better, using the simplest of methods: the checklist. In riveting stories, he reveals what checklists can do, what they can't, and how they could bring about striking improvements in a variety of fields, from medicine and disaster recovery to professions and businesses of all kinds. And the insights are making a difference. Already, a simple surgical checklist from the World Health Organization designed by following the ideas described here has been adopted in more than twenty countries as a standard for care and has been heralded as \"the biggest clinical invention in thirty years\" (The Independent)."
