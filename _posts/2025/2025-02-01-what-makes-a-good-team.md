> No team is perfect, but I think it’s often kind of obvious when a team is bad – there’s usually a level of chaos or drama, a sense that they can’t be relied on or don’t really deliver the value that the organization needs. I think it’s also quite obvious when a team is good, mainly from the output of the team, but the underlying operating that goes into that tend to be less obvious.
> Practically, most teams are somewhere in the middle. Not terrible, but not as good as they could be either. Here’s my list of what I think makes a good team. If you think I’m missing anything please let me know in the comments or on your preferred social media.
