title: What does your manager really mean?
cited: Decoding Your Manager

---

I’m at a stage in my career and life more generally, where I would like to help people - it’s that old cliché of giving back to the technology community.

I would like to build a community of Software Engineers (as that’s my background but everyone is welcome) who would like a candid response to their questions or to help decode what they manager really thinks.

Most managers haven’t had any training and are not good at giving feedback so I thought I would create a place whereby you submit questions and I answer them, leaning on my 20 years of experience in Software Engineering and 7 years of people leadership roles (Engineering Manager, Head of Development, Head of Engineering etc).
