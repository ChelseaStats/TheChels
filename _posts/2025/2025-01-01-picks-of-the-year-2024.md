## Tech

The M4 Mac mini (entry level) for its size and power. It does everything I need and it is probably the best value Mac ever made.

-   Winner: M4 Mac Mini
-   Runner up: N80 keyboard by Royal Kludge

## App

1Password is still the best app across all platforms for me. It's central to managing all my online accounts, private notes and docs for my family.

Castro is a close runner up after some decent changes under new ownership. App seems to struggle under the load of 200 subscriptions though.

-   Winner: 1Password
-   Runner Up: Castro

## Book

-   Runner up: N/A

## Film

-   Runner up: N/A

## Music

Most played artist, most played album artists according to Apple Music

## Podcast

Over the year these two podcasts were often moved to the top of my queue, top, top drawer and tend to be always listen.

-   Winner: Football Cliches
-   Runner up: Three Bean Salad

## Moment

My wife's surgery was the key moment of the year particularly the urgency in which it came about. Slowly very slowly then quickly. It's hampered our lives this year including not taking a family holiday or anniversary trip Venice.

I also got a new job this year and it's night and day on how I feel about work now. Amazing what moving away from a clueless micro manager can do for one's stress levels.

-   Winner: Wife's spinal surgery
-   Runner up: New job

## Business

For overall customer service, speeding responses and good proactive comms

-   Winner: Octopus Energy (Solar & EV chargers)
