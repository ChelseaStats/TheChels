> While it worked, it would’ve worked vastly better by turning the entire team into a mob programming team. We did this after our new Director joined and the change was incredible; it wasn’t enough to have everyone working in the same area, they needed to work on the same thing at the same time, together. Not only did this speed up the entire team, but they grew closer together, collaborated better, and huge chunks of siloing disappeared overnight. Did I mention that we’re fully remote? We are. We still did mob programming, and it was amazing. I highly recommend it as a way of accelerating a team in the storming and norming phases.
