lol.

> [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), finally some open source! Looks like ~943k lines of code, 143k from Basecamp org. Automattic publishes 6.58M lines of open source code, 6.9x more than you. Yet, we're "doing open source dirty"? [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) used Rails to build a $7B/revenue and growing business, why didn't you?
