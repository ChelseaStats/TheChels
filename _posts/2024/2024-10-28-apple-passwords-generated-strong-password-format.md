> I've noticed some of these details, like that the passwords are comprised of little "fake words" and are dominated by lowercase letters, but I hadn't noticed all of them. It's a bunch of clever little touches, all in the aim of making strong passwords that are _convenient_ in odd situations (like typing them with a game controller).

The convience of passwords on odd devices with odd keyboards is to not need passwords at all or to handoff to nearby devices to use a Password Manager like 1Password.
