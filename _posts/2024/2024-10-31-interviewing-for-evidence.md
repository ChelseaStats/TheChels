> Experiential evidence is about things the candidate has done. These questions tend to take the form:

> ‘Tell me about a time when…’
> ‘Can you give me an example of…?’
> ‘Then what did you do?’
> ‘How did you respond?’
> 
> A good experiential question is open, which gives the candidate a chance to share their experience, while being specific enough to prevent the candidate wandering off on tangents, or at least to allow the interviewer to interject if they do.
