title: If you use JavaScript 
cited: Gov.uk

---

> If you use a JavaScript framework you should:
> 
> - be able to justify with evidence, how using JavaScript would benefit users
> - be aware of any negative impacts and be able to mitigate them
> - consider whether the benefits of using it outweigh the potential problems
> - only use the framework for parts of the user interface that cannot be built using HTML and CSS alone
> - design each part of the user interface as a separate component
> 
> Having separate components means that if the JavaScript fails to load, it will only be that single component that fails. The rest of the page will load as normal.
