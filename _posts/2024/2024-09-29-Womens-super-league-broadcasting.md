I spoke to my dad in the summer about how rubbish the FA player was for casting, often streaming the wrong game on the wrong channel and generally a poor UI/UX on the player itself.

I was delighted to see WSL move to YouTube and was happily watching three games concurrently - benefitting from my 34' widescreen. All was going well into the last 10 minutes of two fixtures when both feeds ended prematurely. West Ham went on to equalise and draw 1-1, even the [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/live/cm2y91dp9r3t?post=asset%3Ac6ff6c33-26bc-4376-a989-e44cf808020d#post) Live feed couldn't comment on the goal having had their [feed](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/live/cm2y91dp9r3t?post=asset%3A25ac8e31-cbb4-4e61-8144-8ede85b73359#post) cut short, and Arsenal hung on to beat Leicester 1-0.

A terrible shame.
