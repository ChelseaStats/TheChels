> Pat McFadden will pledge to make the state “more like a start up” as he launches a £100 million fund to pioneer public service reform and deliver the Government’s Plan for Change. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster will warn: “If we keep governing as usual, we are not going to achieve what we want to achieve”.
> The speech about reform of the state comes after the Prime Minister unveiled his plan that will put more money in people’s pockets, get the NHS back on its feet and rebuild Britain.
> Speaking at University College London’s East Campus in Stratford on Monday, Mr McFadden will call for more of Whitehall to adopt the “test and learn culture” of the best digital companies and first-class government projects.
> Test it. Fix the problems. Change the design. Test it again. Tweak it again. And so on, and so on, for as long as you provide the service. Suddenly, the most important question isn’t, ‘How do we get this right the first time?’. It’s ‘How do we make this better by next Friday?
> That’s the test and learn mindset, and I’m keen to see where we can deploy it in government. Where we can make the state a little bit more like a start-up.
> He will launch a new £100 million Innovation Fund to deploy new test-and-learn teams around the country who will apply this mindset to the public sector’s biggest challenges.
