A quick scan revealed I had some issues with my MX records, DMARC and DKIM as well as missing BIMI and MTA-STS. I was able to use this site and supporting linked sites to resolve these issues improving my overall security posture.

Would recommend.

> The idea for Cybaa came from Joe Tiedeman with help from Ade Crossley, born out of the desire for tooling that existed in disparate corners of the internet when he was an infrastructure engineer, there weren't really any decent combined tools that checked web security, email, SPF, DMARC etc, so they set out to build one.
