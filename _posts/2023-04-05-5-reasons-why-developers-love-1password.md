> With our SSH Agent we’ve made your morning git pull as easy and secure as unlocking 1Password – only a scan of your fingerprint required! New keys can be generated in 1Password and synced with Git clients in seconds, then used without the private key ever leaving 1Password. You can use the SSH agent not only for authenticating Git in your daily work, but also to SSH into remote machines. Plus, when you work from other devices, you can take all your keys with you.
