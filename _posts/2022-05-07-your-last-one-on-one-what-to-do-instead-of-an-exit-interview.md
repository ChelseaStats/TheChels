title: Your last one-on-one what to do instead of an exit interview
cited: Jacob Kaplan-Moss

---

> it’s not an “exit interview”, it’s your final one-on-one. If you’ve built a solid relationship with this person, they’ll regularly be bringing problems and even criticism into your 1:1s. If you’ve demonstrated a track record of making it safe to do that, this final meeting can be quite similar. As with any 1:1, if they have things to share, you’re there to listen.
> One way you can implicitly communicate the normality of this meeting is to just keep it at your normally-scheduled 1:1 time.
