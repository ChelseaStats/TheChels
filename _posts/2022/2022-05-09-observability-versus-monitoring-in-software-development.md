> Monitoring is a subset of observability that involves keeping track of important events and metrics so that anomalies, errors, and downtime are noticeable immediately. Metrics monitoring involves identifying specific criteria for success and measuring the performance of the application in relation to these goals. A typical example is queue depth, but metrics might include memory use, requests per second, active connections, flow, or errors.
