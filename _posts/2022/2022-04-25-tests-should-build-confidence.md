> In automated software testing, the default approach among developers is bottom up, and the aims are high coverage and working software.  This approach misunderstands the goal of testing and often fails to deliver on the goal of reliably shipping working software. The idea of the bottom up approach is that you use tests to show that individual parts are correct, that they integrate, and that your system is correct as a result. This approach leads to the typical test pyramid with many tests for small parts at the bottom (unit), fewer tests of larger parts in the middle (integration) and even fewer broad tests at the top (end-to-end). The tests at the bottom are small and quick and the tests at the top are broad and slow.
