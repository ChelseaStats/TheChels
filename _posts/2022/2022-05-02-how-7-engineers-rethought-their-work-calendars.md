> Remote work offers the opportunity to rethink work from first principles and ask ourselves: What does life look like when our jobs work for us, rather than the other way around?

Maybe your day will become nonlinear; maybe you’ll split your workday in two; or maybe you’ll work 4 days instead of 5.
