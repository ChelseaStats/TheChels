> This is the fuzziest category, we all have a lot of strategies and heuristics we pick up along the way for how to debug efficiently. For example:

> - writing a unit test
> - writing a tiny standalone program to reproduce the bug
> - finding a working version of the code and seeing what changed

> - adding extra logging
> - taking a break

> - looking through the github issues to see if anything matches
