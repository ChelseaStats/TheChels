> At the most basic level a Terraform Module is a collection of Terraform code files (.tf) in the same folder. This is the same as a normal Terraform project, except with a Terraform Module you consume the module from another module or project to get infrastructure code reuse. When thinking about code reuse in comparison to other development technologies, it helps to think about a Terraform Module like a library of code that is referenced and called from another library or application of code.
