> Measures of engineering impact are not Accelerate’s measures of developer productivity: lead time, batch size, failure rate, and time to revert. Those measures support understanding and optimizing your development process but aren’t very effective at grading business impact. That’s partially because there are many ways to score highly against those measures without creating much business impact, and partially because they don’t resonate much with folks outside of the engineering organization.
