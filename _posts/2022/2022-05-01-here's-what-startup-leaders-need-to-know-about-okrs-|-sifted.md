title: What startup leaders need to know about OKRs
cited: Sifted

> The objectives in OKRs refer to the ‘what’: inspiring and ambitious yet realistic goals that are connected to delivering business value. For example, one of fintech N26’s objectives is to transform retail banking on a global scale, while the aim of retail company Zalando is to become the “starting point for fashion”.
> The key results are the ‘hows’, or measurable milestones. Once these results are achieved in full, the objective has also been reached. You either deliver on a key result, or you don’t.
