lol. Similar for my work email. I don't understand how gmail, Hotmail et al are not just outright banned for most use cases of non-customer-facing roles.

> This morning, in my works' email inbox via the company's postMaster screening address, I received an email in regards to _Business Funding Offer_ from a babytb69 (at) hotmail.com address. It was not the Baby 69 that concerned me, but the hotmail part of it.
