Before signing up to any website or service I go through the following process:

+ identify site.
  - search for account deletion options
    - on site
    - on search engine
 - search for two factor authentication options
 - search for integrations (ifttt, shortcuts.app, other automation tools, etc)
+ read TOCs and privacy policy
+ look at subscription options
+ create account with throw away email address and password
 - password reset
   - if password is plain text delete / change details and find alternative website/service
   - else continue

+ correct email and password on account.
+ leave as many profile fields empty as possible and delete data where possible.
+ use dedicated one off email address or tag like user+tag[@].domain.tld
+ enable two factor auth options
+ add account to password manager
+ use service

At any point the information returned is not acceptable find an alternative.

Essentially only sign up to services/sites that:

+ support 2FA
+ do not store passwords in plain text
+ share my ethics/morals
+ do not share my data other than absolutely neccesary
+ allows account to be deleted
