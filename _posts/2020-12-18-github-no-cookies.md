> At GitHub, we want to protect developer privacy, and we find cookie banners quite irritating, so we decided to look for a solution. After a brief search, we found one: just donâ€™t use any non-essential cookies. Pretty simple, really. ðŸ¤” So, we have removed all non-essential cookies from GitHub, and visiting our website does not send any information to third-party analytics services.
