title: 'A Personal Growth Framework'

---

> What are you focussing on right now to progress in your career? Ultimately you own your professional development, and you have the ability to make a plan to grow and develop in your role. I want to introduce a Personal Growth Framework – a simple, one-page template you can use to identify areas to grow that are exciting and valuable for your career. It’s time to set some goals and invest in yourself!
