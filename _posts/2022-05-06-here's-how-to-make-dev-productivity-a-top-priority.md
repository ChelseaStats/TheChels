title: Here's how to make dev productivity a top priority

Weird article about dev productivity and basically using scrum velocity and burn downs (which can be gamed easily) and then small pods and individual ownership. Not sure how sustainable this is.

Give the team a scope, a North Star, some direction and space to explore and experiment. Iterate often, inspect and adapt. Repeat. 

> What they settled on was organising the dev team into “pods” of two or three engineers that would work on building any given feature at a time — this avoided having too many cooks in the kitchen and allowed developers to individually assume greater responsibility.
