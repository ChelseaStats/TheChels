title: Handling Defects

---

Defects should be tackled and fixed as soon as possible, rather than establishing a potentially wasteful process of triaging them, classifying them, and storing them in your ticketing system for who knows how long. Look at the Toyota production lines and how they stopped everything to remove issues.

Unless you are late to the party and you already have loads of defects. Then Eisenhower matrix and go go go. Do nothing else until your defect rate is minimal and your test coverage is at the maximum suitable level.
