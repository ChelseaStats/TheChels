title: Running My Business From an iPad

---

> There were very few things I couldn’t do on my iPad, even without a lot of preparation work. Some tasks were slower or more annoying, but even with the small keyboard and no mouse, I wasn’t noticeably worse at doing my day-to-day work.

Interesting view on using an iPad for work, I think I could be pretty close to this as Engineering Manager.  90% of my day is spent in Teams, Slack, GitHub, or in the browser.
