Simply, created some 'issue types' in Jira for this purpose - each template is phrased accordingly asking specific things for each use case.  Took less than 5 minutes to set-up and it's easier to iterate upon. 

> Project selection is very much like optimizing system performance: if you aren’t measuring, then you’ll fix the wrong things. If your team is underwater and looking to dig its way out, the first thing to do is to setup analytics to understand where your team is spending their time.
> Most approaches to instrumenting time allocation require a large time investment from your team to track tasks, which somewhat defeats the plan goal to save their time. One approach I found to work very well, without requiring major workflow changes by your team, is creating a simple internal website that contains your team’s service cookbook.
