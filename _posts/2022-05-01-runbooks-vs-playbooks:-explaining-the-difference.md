> Runbooks are best defined as a tactical method of completing a task--the series of steps needed to complete some process for a known end-goal. Examples include “Restarting the web services on frontend servers” to “Deploying the newest build of staging application”.

> A playbook, on the other hand,is a little broader. It is the culmination of those tactical processes, creating a larger plan focused on strategic action. They are a checklist of formal steps and actions. This can be anything from “Upgrading fleet-wide OS images” to “Managing a production incident." Playbooks contain actions that can be automated, but also actions that decisions that need to be made by a human.
