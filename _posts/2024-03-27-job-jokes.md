title: Jokes about Job Searching

---

- I applied for a job and haven't heard anything. It was at a chiropractors about a weak back.

- I also applied to work for a TV UX design company. But I miss understood when they said it was remote-first.

- I've also missed out on joining a well known large sweet manufacturing business. To be honest it was my fault as I choked in the practical interview.

- Finally I've also interviewed at the bird food making company, but waiting to see if they have a successful seed funding round, as I don't come cheep.

- I've also asked my local hairdressers if they had any vacancies, but they were through a round of cuts.

- Might look at yoghurt companies next as apparently they have great cultures.
