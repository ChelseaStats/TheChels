A bunch of apps I've moved to or used heavily this year.

* Gladys
* Kindle
* Bobby
* Overcast
* Remember the milk
* Flipflop
* PriceRadar
* Working Copy
* 1Password
* Drafts

The kindle app redesign makes reading fun again. The old version was horrible.

Flipflop is a fun solitaire and the only game i really play.

Remember the milk is like todoist but with a shit logo, but without a limit on the inbox (200 on todoist, that i seemed to hit once a week due to repeating tasks doubling up).

PriceRadar was great until a month ago and latest update doesn't seem to work.

I switched from Castro to Overcast due to the podcast level speed setting.
