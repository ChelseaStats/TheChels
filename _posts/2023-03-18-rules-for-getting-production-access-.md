title: Rules for getting production access 
cited: gov.uk

> In the GOV.UK programme we restrict access to production systems for new or returning developers, SREs, and technical architects. We do so to defend against accidental mistakes and to provide time for people build knowledge in how to interact with our production systems safely. Note we have separate processes to protect against malicious activity, for example security clearance, probation, building secure systems with audibility etc.
