cited: Wes Kao

> In this week’s newsletter, we’ll cover principles on how to feel more confident sharing your point of view.

> 1. The more controversial the idea, the higher the burden of proof.
> 2. Update your assumptions about how you add value.
> 3. Share where your hunch is coming from—because it’s coming from somewhere.
> 4. Describe why the problem matters, so people understand why you’re speaking up.
> 5. Don’t rely on your credentials. Your idea should make sense on its own.
> 6. Use language that accurately reflects your level of certainty
