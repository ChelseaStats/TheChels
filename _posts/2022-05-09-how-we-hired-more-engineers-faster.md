> Most questions I ask start with “tell me about a time” or “give an example of a time when you…” I want specifics. If I’m interviewing you, I want to understand if you made something good happen or stood next to people who did. At the same time, do you take all the credit or do you talk about the success of a team? When you have failures is it always somebody else’s fault or do you own your mistakes or problems?
