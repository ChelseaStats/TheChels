> But once you find yourself with those customers and that creaky codebase … what next? How do you start to pay down that debt? Here’s my playbook for managing tech debt:

> 1. Measure: there are no great measures for tech debt, but there are several serviceable ones. Pick one, be consistent, and track it over time.
> 2. Agree on a tech debt allocation, a percentage of time Engineering will spend working on reducing tech debt.
> 3. Monitor and adjust regularly.
