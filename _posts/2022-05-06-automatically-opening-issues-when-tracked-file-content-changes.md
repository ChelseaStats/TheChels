title: Automatically opening issues when tracked file content changes

> It may seem redundant to do this against a file that already lives in version control elsewhere - but in addition to tracking changes, Git scraping can offfer a cheap and easy way to add automation that triggers when a change is detected.
> I need an actionable alert any time the Starlette code changes so I can review the change and apply a fix to my own library, if necessary.
