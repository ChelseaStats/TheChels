> GitHub has created a central accessibility team that consists of designers, engineers, product and program managers—all of whom work with external consultants with disabilities and we subsequently consider their feedback as we build out our solutions. The role of our team is to help enable other teams across GitHub by providing training, tools, and documentation necessary so that teams can build accessible products.
