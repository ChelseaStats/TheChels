I actually prefer half-day stories. It takes discipline, practice and a focus on refining and planning the work to be done.

Focus on thinking slow, but coding fast.

> Story sizes should average as close to one day as possible. If they donâ€™t your Agile project is going to be harder for nearly everyone involved. If your average is significantly greater than that one day, then change something until you get there. Change technologies if you have to, or split stories, or eliminate NFRs (or delay them).
