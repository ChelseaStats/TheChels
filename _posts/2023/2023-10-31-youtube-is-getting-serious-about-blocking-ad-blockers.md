title: YouTube is getting serious about blocking ad blockers
cited: The Verge

Ads are fine imho, but I tried watching a 45 minute show on YouTube and had blocks of 2 non-skippable every three minutes mid-dialogue and it's disruptive. Having to go back 10 seconds to catch what was said.

Put adds at the beginning and end or give content creators power to program in ad breaks.
