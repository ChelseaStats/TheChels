> Write a list of the test scenarios you want to cover.

> Turn exactly one item on the list into an actual, concrete, runnable test.

> Change the code to make the test (and all previous tests) pass (adding items to the list as you discover them).

> Optionally refactor to improve the implementation design

> Until the list is empty, go back to #2.
