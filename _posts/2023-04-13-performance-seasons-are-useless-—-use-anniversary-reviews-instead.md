title: Performance Seasons Are Useless — Use Anniversary Reviews Instead
cited: Jacob Kaplan-Moss

---

> Performing reviews throughout the year mean that the skills you build tend to stick better. If you only do them yearly, you’ll likely forget whatever you learned by the time the next season rolls around. But if your next review comes in a month or two, you’re more likely to retain and build on your skillset. That’s a virtuous cycle: it makes each review easier, so they take less time, so you can do them more often and capture more data, and so on.
