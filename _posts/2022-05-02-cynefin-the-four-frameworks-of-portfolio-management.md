> Cynefin, created by Dave Snowden in 1999, is a decision-making framework for working with complex systems. Cynefin—named after the Welsh word for “habitat”—is designed to assist decision making by applying decisions to domains. This domain structure allows decision makers to understand where they are in a complex adaptive system and what form of experimentation they should be using to make their decisions at that time. Specifically, it helps business leaders understand which specific point in the decision-making process they are in and how to react.
