cited: Wes Kao

> In this week’s newsletter, we’ll cover how to get more and better feedback from your manager:

> 1. Make it insanely easy for your manager to give you feedback.
> 2. “Feedback” might feel loaded. Ask what to do differently and what worked well.
> 3. Give them permission to rip your work apart.
> 4. Don’t romanticize feedback. You might already be getting it.
> 5. Give your manager something concrete to react to.
> 6. Don’t expect your manager to create a structured lesson plan for you.
> 7. React positively when you get feedback.
> 8. Frame why giving you feedback is ROI positive. It’s not always obvious or true.
> 9. Specify what part you need help with.
> 10. Be explicit about the type of feedback you’re looking for.
> 11. Be the kind of operator managers want to invest in.
