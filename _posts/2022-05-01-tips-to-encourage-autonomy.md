1. Let Children Make Choices.
"Are you in the mood for your gray trousers, or your red trousers?"
2. Show Respect for a Child’s Struggle.
"A jar can be hard to open. Sometimes it helps if you tap the lid
with a spoon."
3. Don’t Ask Too Many Questions.
"Glad to see you. Welcome home."
4. Don’t Rush to Answer Questions.
"That’s an interesting question. what do you think?"
5. Encourage Children to Use Sources Outside the Home.
"Maybe the pet shop owner would have a suggestion."
6. Don’t Take Away Hope.
"so you’re thinking of trying out for the play! that should be an experience"
